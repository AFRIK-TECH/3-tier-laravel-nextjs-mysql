## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

You may also try the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com), where you will be guided through building a modern Laravel application from scratch.

If you don't feel like reading, [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) can help. Laracasts contains thousands of video tutorials on a range of topics including Laravel, modern PHP, unit testing, and JavaScript. Boost your skills by digging into our comprehensive video library.

handle cors in laravel 11+

In Laravel 12, middleware configuration has been centralized in the bootstrap/app.php file. The HandleCors middleware, which manages Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), is part of Laravel's core and is located at:​

\Illuminate\Http\Middleware\HandleCors::class

To ensure that the HandleCors middleware is applied globally in your application, you should register it within the bootstrap/app.php file. Here's how you can do it:​
Laravel+2GitHub+2Laravel News+2

    Open the bootstrap/app.php File:

    Navigate to the bootstrap directory in your Laravel project and open the app.php file.

    Register the HandleCors Middleware:

    Within the app.php file, use the withMiddleware method to append the HandleCors middleware to the global middleware stack:

    use Illuminate\Foundation\Application;
    use Illuminate\Foundation\Configuration\Middleware;
    use Illuminate\Http\Middleware\HandleCors;

    return Application::configure(basePath: dirname(__DIR__))
        ->withMiddleware(function (Middleware $middleware) {
            // Append the HandleCors middleware to the global middleware stack
            $middleware->append(HandleCors::class);
        })
        // Other configurations...
        ->create();

This configuration ensures that the HandleCors middleware is included in the global middleware stack, handling CORS for all incoming requests.

    Configure CORS Settings:

    If you haven't already, create a config/cors.php file to define your CORS settings. Here's an example configuration that allows all origins:

    <?php

    return [
        'paths' => ['api/*'],
        'allowed_methods' => ['*'],
        'allowed_origins' => ['*'],
        'allowed_origins_patterns' => [],
        'allowed_headers' => ['*'],
        'exposed_headers' => [],
        'max_age' => 0,
        'supports_credentials' => false,
    ];

This setup permits all methods, origins, and headers for routes matching api/*.

    Clear Configuration Cache:

    After making these changes, clear the configuration cache to ensure they take effect:

    php artisan config:clear

By following these steps, you can effectively manage CORS in your Laravel 12 application using the HandleCors middleware.​

Note: In previous versions of Laravel, middleware was registered in the app/Http/Kernel.php file. However, starting from Laravel 11, middleware configuration has been moved to the bootstrap/app.php file.
